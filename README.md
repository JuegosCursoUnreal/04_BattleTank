# Battle Tank

## Concept
* The game is a tank battleground, players will spawn at one side of the battleground and waves of incomming enemy tanks piloted by a simple AI will come to face them, at each wave the amount of enemy tanks will increment making it difficult to keep fighting, the game will end when an amount of waves have been destroyed, the game uses advanced control systema and its built using Unreal Engine 4.

## Rules
* The tanks will take damage when hit by enemy volleys.
* The tanks can repair at the center of the map by sitting on top of a repair station but the tank must remain still, it cant do anything, making them vulnerable.
* Tanks can use terrain and structures for cover.
* When the health of the tank reach zero the tank will be destroyed, if a player’s tank is destroyed the player will lose the game.
* When a tank’s ammo reaches zero the tank wont be able to shoot until he recharges ammo by sitting at the center of the map at the repair platform.

## Requirements
* The actual mesh of the tank.
* Sound effects for the tank movement and projectile shooting.
* Background music.
* Images and UI/UX elements for the main menu.
